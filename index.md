### Data Analysis and ML

The project involves developing a movie recommendation system using machine learning. The data is analyzed and transformed, including cleaning, unnesting nested fields, handling null values, and creating new columns. An exploratory data analysis is performed using Power BI, and an API is developed using FastAPI. The recommender system is based on genre similarity and returns a list of the 5 most similar movies. Tools used include FastAPI, uvicorn, Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Power BI.
